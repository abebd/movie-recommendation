
### TODO:
* User should be able to "add" movie, aka movie it from the recommendations folder to main folder
* User should be able to "rate" movies, aka updated watched to true (if not allready), update personalRating with user input and at the same time lastWatched should get set to todays date

### Future things
* Implement failsafe, if llm gives an answer not querably, redo the whole function - or resend the prompt
* Implement ignore movies, movies which the AI has recommended but the user does not like
